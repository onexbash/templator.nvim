# TEMPLATOR.NVIM

## Introduction

This project only exists because I was too lazy to permanently do the same things when adding new nvim plugins. Also I wanted to have a consistent structure of my plugin specs.
All this plugin does is generating a starting point for configuring a new plugin and placing it in ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/<plugin-name>.lua

## Vision

I want to keep this project alive and make it work for more than just plugins. 
My vision is to basically have a wizard that helps configuring neovim. 
Well.. Lets see :D 
Feel free to help if you like the idea.


## Roadmap
- Let user change plugin directory
- Templating of a well-thought nvim directory structure
- Support for packer
- Idk, let me know what functionality I should add
